            <h2 class="title">Paris, France</h2>
            <p class="city-content">Paris, France's capital, is a major European city and a global center for art,
                fashion, gastronomy and culture. Its 19th-century cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the
                River Seine. Beyond such landmarks as the Eiffel Tower and the 12th-century, Gothic Notre-Dame
                cathedral, the city is known for its cafe culture and designer boutiques along the Rue du Faubourg
                Saint-Honor√©. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>

            <p>Paris: it's not easy arriving alone in one of the world's most romantic cities.
                Everywhere you look there seem to be couples strolling, enjoying drinks, dinner or the sights. But you
                can have a brilliant time in Paris by yourself. It's a remarkable city - very easy to navigate on foot
                as well as by Metro - but full of unexpected delights which you don't have to be with anyone else to
                have a truly memorable time</p>

            <p>Paris is a beautiful city. Making the most of the scenery, I never catch the
                metro to get to and from places that I want to visit. The most beautiful and scenic way to one side of
                Paris to the other, is a walk along the River Seine. This guide is my way of expressing my absolute,
                unconditional love for Paris. There is always something new and exciting to see here, whether you have
                been here once or several times. It's a comfortable place, where the people are friendly and the streets
                are safe for nighttime walks to the Eiffel Tower and a late night cafe visit. As someone who has been to
                Paris 3 times and loves it more than my own home city, here are my recommendations for a wonderful visit
            </p>
