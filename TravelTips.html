            <h2>#1 The best time to visit Paris is in the shoulder seasons</h2>
            <p>Of all the Paris holiday tips I have, this is one of my top recommended! What this means is that the best
                time to go to Paris is just before or just after peak season (i.e. Summer). This way, you’ll still get
                the good weather, albeit without as many of the crowds that inevitably visit during the warmer months of
                the year.
                Spring and autumn also provide perfect photo opportunities, with cherry blossom season in April and fall
                foliage spotting in October and November. Visit outside of peak season and you can also expect to find
                fewer queues and invariably lower prices when it comes to plane fares and accommodation. To find the
                best airfare/ bus/ train fares in advance,</p>

            <h2>#2 Plan your accommodation well in advance and stay in a central location</h2>
            <p>Only book your accommodation close to the aiport if you’re getting a flight early the next morning, and
                only then for that night only. When it comes to your Paris visit, accommodation is going to be a large
                portion (if not the largest allocation) of your travel budget.

                As such, I highly recommend booking your stay well in advance. Choosing a place to stay in Paris is
                dependent entirely on your own personal travel preferences. Most of the luxury hotels can be found in
                the 8th arrondissement of the city, while more budget locations can be found near the peripherique.
                Check here for the best accommodation rates in Paris.

                Otherwise, if you’re looking to get a local’s perspective on the city and don’t feel like dining out
                every night, then you might consider booking an apartment on Air Bnb. From luxurious studios offering
                views of the Eiffel tower to budget rooms, there’s something for every price range. New to Air BnB? Sign
                up with this link to get credit towards your first booking!</p>

            <h2>#3 Use public transportation</h2>
            <p>Avoid taxis and traffic queues and hop on the metro instead. Fast, efficient, and affordable, if you’re
                planning on taking the metro a fair few times, or are travelling as part of a group, be sure to purchase
                a ‘carnet’. This is essentially a pack of ten metro tickets and offers a cheaper rate than buying each
                metro ticket individually.

                Though Paris metro tickets are being gradually phased out in favour of the Easy Navigo pass, they’ll
                still be on sale for at least another year or two. When using public transportation keep a close eye on
                your belongings at all times, especially on the metro.

                A common scam is for someone to ‘offer’ to help you purchase metro tickets, only to scam you of money
                and buy a cheap ticket that’s only valid for one journey. This scam is particularly prevalent around
                Gare du Nord and so be sure to only buy tickets from the machines or at the designated kiosk directly.

            <h2>#4 Paris is a city best explored on foot</h2>
            <p>Like many European capital cities, Paris is a place best explored on foot. Prepare to walk plenty. After
                all, I often find that it’s only when I’m wandering around Paris that I truly get a feel for the
                authentic Paris and see the settlement from a local’s perspective.

                This way, you’ll also get the opportunity to peek behind those doorways and discover the hidden gems you
                might have otherwise missed if you were sat on a bus or standing on the metro! For example, this Le
                Marais walking tour will show you the best of medieval Paris and this old Paris vintage tour will allow
                you to experience the highlights of the city in just a few hours..
